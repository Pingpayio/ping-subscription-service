# Progress: NEAR Subscription Service

## What Works

### Smart Contract

- [ ] Scheduler integration (job management)
- [ ] API route organization (scheduler.ts, agent.ts)
- [ ] Advanced error handling and logging
- [ ] Rate limiting and security measures

### Scheduler Service
- [x] Basic service setup with BullMQ/PostgreSQL
- [x] Job management API (`/jobs` endpoints)

## Current Status

We have completed the smart contract implementation phase and made significant progress on the SDK and Shade Agent implementation. The contract includes worker agent verification, subscription data structures and methods, key registration, payment processing, and merchant management. We've updated the subscription key flow to improve security and automation.

The project is now focusing on completing the Shade Agent implementation and developing the UI components.

## Known Issues

1. **TEE Integration**: Need to ensure proper integration between TEE attestation and the smart contract.
2. **Key Management**: Need to enhance secure key generation and storage within TEEs for better security.
3. **Gas Optimization**: Need to optimize contract methods for gas usage.
4. **Payment Reliability**: 
   - Need to implement robust error handling in the API service's payment trigger endpoint
   - Configure appropriate retry mechanisms in the scheduler service
   - Implement monitoring for failed jobs and payment attempts
5. **API Organization**: Need to better organize the API codebase (separate scheduler.ts, agent.ts)
6. **Scheduler Integration**: Need to ensure reliable communication between API and scheduler services
