# Product Context: NEAR Subscription Service

## Why This Project Exists

Traditional subscription services have several limitations in Web3:

1. **Security Risks**: Most require users to pre-approve unlimited token spending, creating security vulnerabilities.
2. **User Control**: Users often lack transparency and control over their subscription payments.
3. **Technical Complexity**: Implementing recurring payments on blockchain is challenging due to the lack of native "pull payment" mechanisms.
4. **Cross-Chain Limitations**: Most subscription solutions are chain-specific and don't work across different blockchains.

This project aims to solve these problems by leveraging NEAR's Function Call Access Keys and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to create a secure, user-controlled subscription service.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Limited Authorization**: Instead of unlimited approvals, users create function call access keys with specific allowances and method restrictions.
2. **Secure Key Management**: Private keys are stored and used within TEEs, preventing exposure.
3. **Automated Payments**: Shade Agents automatically process payments when due without requiring user action.
4. **Transparent Terms**: All subscription terms are clearly defined and visible to users.
5. **Cross-Chain Potential**: The architecture supports future expansion to other chains through NEAR Chain Signatures.

## How It Should Work

### For Users:
1. User selects a subscription plan from a merchant
2. User approves creation of a function call access key with specific limitations
3. User creates the subscription, linking it to the access key
4. Payments are automatically processed when due
5. User can view, pause, or cancel the subscription at any time

### For Merchants:
1. Merchant registers with the subscription service
2. Merchant defines subscription plans (amount, frequency, etc.)
3. Merchant receives payments automatically when due
4. Merchant can view analytics and reports on subscriptions

### For the System:
1. Shade Agents monitor subscriptions for due payments
2. When a payment is due, the agent retrieves the private key from secure storage
3. The agent signs and submits the payment transaction
4. The system verifies the key is authorized for the subscription
5. The payment is processed and the next payment date is updated

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The subscription creation process should be straightforward and user-friendly.
2. **Transparency**: Users should have clear visibility into their subscription terms and payment history.
3. **Control**: Users should be able to easily manage their subscriptions (pause, cancel, etc.).
4. **Security**: Users should feel confident that their funds are secure and only authorized payments will be processed.
5. **Reliability**: Payments should be processed reliably and on time.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Limited Authorization**: Unlike most Web3 subscription services, users don't need to approve unlimited spending.
2. **TEE Security**: Private keys are secured within TEEs, providing hardware-level protection.
3. **User Control**: Users have full visibility and control over their subscriptions.
4. **Cross-Chain Potential**: The architecture is designed to support multiple blockchains in the future.
